# Hate Speech Detection with Oversampling Techniques
Non-hate speech is easily detected due to the abundance of data available. However, there is a comparative lack of hate speech data on which models can be trained.
Focus on the accurate identification of hate-speech data stems from the fact that the ability to correctly (Precision) and thoroughly (Recall) detect and identify specific types of hate speech is more desirable. Two machine learning models have been employed for a comparative analysis of hate-speech detection - Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Keeping in mind the problem of lack of hate-speech instances in most datasets, several resampling techniques have also been used; namely Random oversampling, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), and ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Algorithm) in combination with the two learning models.
